# AGLA_LSA_-_PredatorPrey
This repository contains the implementation of Matrix / Column Vectors behavior for solving linear systems of equations through: Gauss elimination, Jacobi iterative methods, and Seidel iterative methods. 

The program implements Least Square Approximation, which gave an approximate value for coefficients of n-degree polynomial.

Also there is predator-prey model
